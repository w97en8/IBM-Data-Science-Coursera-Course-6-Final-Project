# IBM-Data-Science-Coursera-Course-6-Final-Project

This is the final project for course 6 in the IBM Data Science course on Coursera. In this project, we are to load datasets into an SQLite database and execute SQL queries in order to analyze the data.

This project includes the following criteria:
1. Given three Chicago datasets (Chicago public schools data, Chicago crime data, and Chicago census data)
2. Using Pandas and sqlite3 libraries to establish a connection to a database
3. Load the SQL magic module and further use Pandas to load Chicago datasets to dataframes via URL links and pd.readcsv() command
4. Load data onto database useing .tosql() commands and establish connection between SQL magic module and database via %sql sqlite:/// command

These skills can be used to analyze a plethora of variables including, but not limited to:

- School types and their average safety scores
- Community areas with the highest percentage of households below the poverty line
- Most crime prone community areas, community area names with the most number of crimes
